NorthernMail - Client
=====================

The NorthernSec mail client is a mail client used to access the
NorthernSec darknet mailserver.

Our goals
---------

With this project, we aim to give users a truly anonymous and open
 source mailing platform. We aim for high security, and anonymity while
 maintaining interraction userfriendly and easy.

Why a darknet mailserver?
-------------------------

By keeping people from sending mails to outsiders, or outsiders from
 sending mails to the darknet users, we aim to keep data leakage and
 security risk to an absolute minimum.

Why Java?!
----------

I know what you're thinking; "This project is supposed to be secure,
 but it's made in Java?". We are aware that Java is not the most secure
 programming language, but since Java is crossplatform and installed on
 most computers, it is the most readily available platform for users.
We plan on recoding the client in different languages as well, so stay
 tuned.

Open source
-----------

We encourage you to read the source code and help us securing and
 optimizing this project. That's why we make it open source.
